# About me

Ex Java developer, trying to get back into the scene, full time force of chaos.
I love making project that solve very specific problems, mostly aimed at neurospicy people, Like myself.
From projects that turn your images into a scrambled mess, to a fridge helper (WIP) that keeps track of expiration dates, I make it all.

Currently I am working on:
> FridgeBuddy: the fridge assistant your brain didn't realize it needed.
> Runelite streamer plugin: An external tool/internal plugin combination to show ingame info in a streamer friendly layout.
> Runelite utils: a small collection of personal util plugins, just so I don't have to grab a calculator.
> KoboldHoarder NEO: a bit of a joke project meant to get me back into coding, is currently becoming a centerpiece for future employers to see all my different skills.
> VaultLin: Encryptes secret keeper, with TOTP and pin support, for that masterpassword to your passwordmanager, and other less critical info.
> Pixelator V2: A library version of my [old Pixelator app](https://github.com/SpyroManiac/Pixelizer), on my old git, with new features planned.

 and many many more, the hoard of projects will keep growing!
