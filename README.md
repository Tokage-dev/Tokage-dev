# 🐉 Kage Tokage // @tokage-dev

Java developer. Hoarder of unfinished projects. Secretly 3 kobolds in a trenchcoat.

I build apps mostly for myself, but with broader appeal in mind.

## 🧠 About Me

Ex-Java developer, currently crawling back into the scene like a well-dressed gremlin.

I love making projects that solve **very specific**, often neurospicy problems—because I’m like that too.  
From apps that scramble your images into art-chaos to a fridge helper that screams when your yogurt expires, I make what I wish existed.

## 🛠️ Currently Working On

- **FridgeBuddy** – The fridge assistant your brain didn’t know it needed.
- **Runelite Streamer Plugin** – Combines external tools + plugin hooks for stream-friendly overlays.
- **Runelite Utils** – A grab-bag of handy plugins to save me from math.
- **Runelite Pet Chance Tracker** - Tracks the chance you had a pet, so you can question your life choices.
- **KoboldHoarder NEO** – A joke project turned centerpiece for showcasing my dev skills.
- **VaultLin** – TOTP + PIN protected local vault for master passwords and other secrets.
- **Pixelator V2** – A cleaned-up, modular remake of my [old Pixelator app](https://github.com/SpyroManiac/Pixelizer) with fresh features.

> *...and many more. The project hoard only grows.*
